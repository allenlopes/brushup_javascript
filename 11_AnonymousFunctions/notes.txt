#1] Anonymous functions are those functions wherein we don't need to keep name for it.

#2] We create a function which don't have any name, and it will be automatically called.

#3] Why do we use Anonymous functions?
->  * Whenever we don't need functions that much to use, but in out code there are variables which can be conflicted, then we use anonymous functions.
    * Whenever we know that the function we made, will work as function only, but it's requirement is not more than one time, ]
      at that time too we can use anonymous functions inside an variable and call it.


#4] Let's say we create two files, which includes code,
    File 1 - 1_test.js ->
                        let x = 10;
                        let y = 20;
                        document.write(x + y);

    File 2 - 2_test.js ->
                        let x = 30;
                        let y = 40;
                        document.write(x * y);

    We call the above two files inside our index.html as using script tag,
                <script src="1_test.js"></script>
                <script src="2_test.js"></script>

    But, only the first file will give output(i.e x + y = 30) but we won't get output for 2nd file.
    Because, we have created variable with 'let' and as we know that once the variable is initialized with 'let',
    we won't be able to initialize the same variable name with 'let'.

    What happened is both the javascript we included in our index.html file has the variable with same names, which will become conflict.

    Even if we create functions to call them differently, maybe functions will also conflict because of same function name.
    So, here we use anonymous function.
    Anonymous function for two .js files,
    File 1 - 1_test.js ->
                        // Anonymous function
                        (function () {
                        let x = 10;
                        let y = 20;
                        document.write(x + y);
                        }) ();

    File 2 - 2_test.js ->
                        // Anonymous function
                        (function () {
                        let x = 10;
                        let y = 20;
                        document.write(x * y);
                        }) ();
        For the above at last () this indicates function is called.

    Because of creating anonymous function, the variables are independent.


#5] Another way to use anonymous function is that the output can be taken inside an variable.
    For ex, if we create <script> inside our index.html file then,
        <script>
            var x = function (){
                document.write("Hello");
            }
            x(); // Printing the anonymous function by calling the variable name.
        </script>
