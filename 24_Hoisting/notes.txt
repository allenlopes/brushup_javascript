#1] In javascript what happens is if we first call the function and then define it, it won't give an error.
    Like for eg, ->
    // calling a function before defining it.
    hello(); // here we have called the function
    // and then we defined it,
    function hello(){
        document.write("Hey Allen");
    }

    But, when we define a function in a variable and try to call the variable even before defining it, then it will give error.
    Like for eg, ->
    // calling a function through variable before defining it.
    hello(); // here we have called the variable
    // and then defined it,
    var hello = function() {
        document.write("Hey World!");
    }


#2] Suppose we define the value of x and then print it, it will give the output, like for eg,
    var x = 10;
    document.write(x);

    But, what if we just print x? Like,
    document.write(x);
    It wil give us an error as "x is not defined" in our console.

    But, what if we call x first and then define it? Like,
    document.write(x);
    var x = 10;
    It will give us the output as "undefined" on our screen


#3] Here, what happens is When, we call the variable first and then define it,
    Like,
    document.write(x);
    var x = 10;
    In the background working of javascript,
    var x;
    x = "undefined"
    and then it prints the x in,
    document.write(x);

    So, that's why we get the output as undefined.


#4] If we have made an variable, and just defined it and not inserted any value in it,
    Like,
    var x;
    document.write(x)
    Or Else,
    if we have made an variable and also inserted some value in it but called it before,
    Like,
    document.write(x);
    var x = 10;
    then for bothe the cases we will get output as "undefined"


#5] Suppose if we call x first and then have defined the value to it, but without giving any variable name(like - var, const, let)
    Like,
    document.write(x);
    x = 10;
    In this case it will display error as "x is not defined" inside our console.
# When we haven't given any variable name to x i.e var, let, const; then it will give such error.


#6] Same thing we have done earlier in 2_index.html, tried to call the variable as if it's function,
    that's why it gave error in our console.


#7] When we first define value of x without giving it variable name(var, let, const) and then print it,
    it won't give an error.
    Like,
    x = 10;
    document.write(x);

    But,
    if we write "use strict" inside our program, it will give us an error in our console as "x is not defined"
    Basically "use strict" means it tells us that we have to compulsory tell the variable(var, let, const) we have to use,
    Like,
    "use strict"
    x = 10;
    document.write(x)
