#1] Loops are of three types ->
    1. For Loop
    2. While Loop
    3. Do-While Loop
    4. For-in Loop (Related to object)
    5. Foreach Loop (Related to array)


#2] Whenever one thing is going to repeat, here loops can be used.


#3] Whenever there is use of Loops we need three things,
    1. start
    2. end
    3. increment or decrement condition
    4. break
    5. continue


#4] Suppose we want to print "Hello Allen" for 10 times, then what we would do is, output document.write("Hello Allen") for 10 times,
        document.write("Hello Allen")
        document.write("Hello Allen")
        document.write("Hello Allen")
        document.write("Hello Allen")
        document.write("Hello Allen")
        document.write("Hello Allen")
        document.write("Hello Allen")
        document.write("Hello Allen")
        document.write("Hello Allen")
        document.write("Hello Allen")

    So, basically we have print "Hello Allen" for 10 times,
    Instead of printing it one by one for 10 times, we can use for loop to make our task easier.
