#4] Two types of Functions ->
    1. Parameterized Function
    2. Non Parameterized Function


#5] 1. Parameterized Function -
        Parameterized Functions are those functions where we pass values or variables inside (),
        For ex, -
        function addNumber(x , y){
            document.write(x + y);
        }
        addNumber(10, 20);
    So, in the above example as we can see we have passed x and y inside function addNumber,
    So, when later on when we call the addNumber function, we also give 2 values on place of x and y, inside our (), and
    it takes that values and place it instead of x and y and give result of x + y as stated in the function.

    2. Non Parameterized Function
        Non Parameterized Functions are those functions wherein we don't pass values inside (),
        For ex, -
        function addNumber(){
            var x = 10;
            var y = 20;
            document.write(x+y);
        }
        addNumber();
        So,in the above example as we can see we have already declared the values of x and y inside our function addNumber,
        So, to peform any operations on them we just later on call that function, without passing any values inside ().


#6] We can access variables in javascript using local variable and global variable
