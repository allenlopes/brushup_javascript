#1] We used three types of Document.getElement,
    which are -> 1. Document.getElementById, 2. Document.getElementByClassName, 3. Document.getElementByTagName


#2] So just like that we have querySelector,
    the syntax for it is, Document.querySelector();


#3] Suppose we have used id inside our <div> tag then we have to use "#" inside our Document.querySelector('#box')
    Like for ex,
<div id="box"> Allen </div>

<script>

    let name = document.querySelector('#box'); // here we have used #box, which means we are calling div with id = box
    console.log(name);

</script>


#4] Suppose we have used class inside our <div> tag then we have to use "." inside our Document.querySelector('.box')
    Like for ex,
<div class="box"> Allen </div>

<script>

    let name = document.querySelector('.box'); // here we have used .box, which means we are calling div with class = box
    console.log(name);

</script>


#5] Suppose we haven't used class or id inside our <div> tag and just used <div> tag
    then we just specify the div inside our querySelector like, inside our Document.querySelector('div')
    Like for ex,
<div> Allen </div>

<script>

    let name = document.querySelector('div'); // here we have used div, which means we are calling the div using querySelector
    console.log(name);

</script>
