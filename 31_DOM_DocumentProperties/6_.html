        //  console.log(document.images[0]); // it will only display me the image at index position 0, i.e the first image with src as allen.png, in our console

           console.log(document.images[0].src); // it will display me the image at index position 0 with it's source address, i.e the first image with src as allen.png, in our console along with it's source address in our local computer.
