#1] Math object is an predefined object in javascript, and with the help of it we can perform mathematical tasks can be performed.
    1. Math.round()
    2. Math.ceil()
    3. Math.floor()
    4. Math.trunc()
    5. Math.pow()
    6. Math.sqrt()
    7. Math.abs()
    8. Math.min()
    9. Math.max()
    10. Math.random()
    11. Math.log()



#2] 1. Math.round() -> Basically it rounds up the floating number upto it's closest integer number,
    Like if we gave number 10.5, so Math.round function will round it up to number 11,
    Or, if number is 13.3, then it will round it up to it's closest integer i.e 13
    Code eg, ->
    var x = 13.3;
    document.write(Math.round(x));


    2. Math.ceil() -> Basically it will round up the floating number to it's next integer number,
    Like if we gave number 11.2, it will round it to number 12, even though 11.2 is closer to 11, then too it will round
    it up to it's next integer.
    Code eg, ->
    var x = 11.2;
    document.write(Math.ceil(x));


    3. Math.floor() -> Basically it's just opposite of Math.ceil() function, it rounds up the floating number to it's integer number,
    Like if we gave number 11.9, it will round it to number 11, even though 11.9 is closer to 12, then too it will round
    it upto it's integer only.
    Code eg, ->
    var x = 11.9;
    document.write(Math.floor(x));


    4. Math.trunc() -> It works same as Math.floor() function, like whatever the integers would be there after . in an
    floating number it ignores them and print just the number,
    Like if we gave number 23.999, it will remove the .999 number and give the output as 23.
    Code eg, ->
    var x = 23.999;
    document.write(Math.trunc(x));


    5. Math.pow() -> Basically it means power of number, it gives the output by calculating the power of that number,
    Here we have to put 2 numbers in the function in which 1st number is the number and 2nd number is it's power,
    Like it works as Math.pow(3,2), which means 3^2 i.e 3's square which will give output as 9, OR
    Math.pow(4,3), which means 4^2 i.e 4's cube which will give output as 64.
    Code eg, ->
    document.write(Math.pow(4,3));


    6. Math.sqrt() -> It removes the square root of a given number,
    Like if given number is 25, so it removes it's square root and give output as 5, which is square root of 25.
    Code eg, ->
    document.write(36)


    7. Math.abs() -> It gives the inputed negative number as positive number in output,
    Like if given number is -99.192, so it gives the output in positive number as 99.192.
    Code eg, ->
    var x = -10.999
    document.write(Math.abs(x));


    8. Math.min() -> Here we give input as series of numbers,
    Like if give give numbers as 20, 7, 23, 2 as input, it will give the output of the minimum number from it, i.e 2
    Code eg, ->
    document.write(Math.min(20, 7, 23, 2));


    9. Math.max() -> Here we give input as series of numbers,
    Like if give give numbers as 20, 7, 23, 2 as input, it will give the output of the maximum number from it, i.e 23
    Code eg, ->
    document.write(Math.max(20, 7, 23, 2));


    10. Math.random() -> When we use this function, it will Basically give us any random numbers output
    whenever we refresh the page, without giving any input numbers to it,
    Like it will display output as any random numbers,
    Code eg, ->
    document.write(Math.random())

    // The random numbers which are displaying are in Basically floating numbers, like 0.3453434 or 0.255432 etc..
    To make it proper integer positive number we can multiply the random number generated with power of 10,
    Code eg, ->
    var x = Math.random()*1000;
    document.write(x)

    // But the above number generated is also into integer number, like 9.2345 or 5.345654, etc..
    To make it proper integer number without any decimal point numbers, we can use our Math.trunc() function.
    Code eg, ->
    var y = Math.random()*1000;
    document.write(Math.trunc(x));


    11. Math.log() -> It helps in removing log of a number,
    Like if we want log of number 23, we can use Math.log() function, then it outputs the log of number 23(but in decimal point number)
    Since, it displays the log of 23 in decimal point number, we can make use of Math.trunc() function to remove decimal point,
    and display output as integer number.
    Code eg, ->
    document.write(Math.log(10));
