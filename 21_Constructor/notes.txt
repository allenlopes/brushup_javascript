#1] We create 2 object variables,
    var obj1 = {
        fname: "Allen",
        lname: "Lopes"
    };

    var obj2 = {
        fname: "Sall",
        lname: "Dmello"
    }

    The problem here is suppose if we want to create more object variables like for 10-20 times, then we have to again and again,
    write the same obj variables, like if we want to create obj3 then,
    var obj3 = {
        fname: "qwert",
        lname: "zxcv"
    }
    .
    .
    .
    .Same var for obj4, obj5, obj6 and etc..

    Here we use the constructor which makes it easier for usand reduces lines of code.


#2] When we create constructor we have to give the first letter of the function name as capital,
    like for example,
    function User(){      // so here the function User has first letter as capital.

    }


#3] So we create a constructor like this,

function User(fn, ln){
    //Here we assign the value to constructor
    this.fname = fn;
    this.lname = ln;
}


#4] Now, we are creating object thorugh constructor,
    // here we are creating an object and assigning values to it
    var obj = new User("Allen", "Lopes");
    console.log(obj); // it will print the obj values inside our console on browser

    # The main benefit of constructor is that we can now just create new object with another name and assign new values to it
    and print it, like we create object 2
    var obj2 = new User("Sall", "Dmello");
    console.log(obj2); // it will print the obj2 values inside our console on browser


#5] Suppose we want to add another property inside our object but without modifing the constructor, so we can add it by
    just modifing the object.
    Like suppose we have,
    var obj2 = new User("Sall", "Dmello");
    console.log(obj2); // it will print the obj2 values inside our console on browser
    // now we want to add another property of 'age', so we can add it by,
    obj2.age = 20;

    * Note that the new property 'age' was just added to obj2 and it won't affect any other property other then obj2.


#6] Let's see how we create a function inside our constructor,
    <script>
    function User(fn, ln){
        this.fname = fn;
        this.lname = ln;
        // executing through function
        this.fullname = function(){
            return this.fname+" "+this.lname;
        }
    }
        // creating an object
        var obj = new User("Sal", "Dmello");
        console.log(obj); // it will print the obj2 values inside our console on browser
