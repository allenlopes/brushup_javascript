#1] Variables in Javascript are used to store values.

#2] Variables are used when we want to store information that needs to be used repeatedly.

#3] We write Variables in 3 ways in Javascript ->
    1. var
    2. let
    3. const

#4] 1. var -> if we declare variable var name = 'Allen', it will display Allen in the output when it is called inside
                document.write(name),
                if suppose we declare - var name = 'Allen'
                                        name = 'Sall'
                the name = 'Allen' will be overwritten by name = 'Sall' and we will get the output as Sall whenever name is called.
                Basically, it will remove old value and replace it with new value.

            * Note - It is not compulsory to use variable var while declaring variable, even if we declare it without variable,
            like suppose name = 'Allen' and then output it to document.write(name), then it will display the name value 'Allen'.


#5] 2. let -> just like we declared variable var we have variable let, like let name = 'Allen' it will display Allen in the output when it is called inside
                document.write(name),

            When ES6(Ecma Script 6) was introduced, let was added.
            Basically let and var both function the same, but there is one big difference between them, let's understand that,

            if suppose first we declare - let name;
        and then we give value to name -  name = 'Allen';
        it will display the name as Allen when document.write(name) is called, since after declaring variable we can later on give the value to the variable.

        now, if suppose first we declare - let name = 'Allen';
and again we declare variable name with let - let name = 'Sall';
it will not display any output and display syntax error inside console.

        now if suppose using var first we declare - var name = 'Allen'
    and again we declare variable name with var -   var name = 'Sall'
here, it will display the output as Sall and name 'Allen' will be overwritten by 'Sall'.


        so, as you can see the main difference between var and let is,
        once we initialized variable let name, we again cannot initialize the variable with same variable name,
        like let name = 'Allen'
             let name = 'Sall'  this is wrong in let since, in let we can only initialize variable name once.
             In LET we cannot define the variable with same name again.
        WHILE,
        in variable var if we initialize var name once, we can again initialize the variable with the same variable name,
        like var name = 'Allen'
             var name = 'Sall' this is correct in var, and overwrite the var name = 'Allen' with var name = 'Sal'.
             In VAR we can define the variable with same name again.


        * Note that even if we declared the variable with same name but different variable it will display error,
        like suppose first we declare - var name = 'Allen'
                and then we declare -   let name = 'Allen' this is wrong and it will display error.
        The above condition will also not work in vice versa case.


#6] 3. const -> const means constant, like once we declare it, we cannot change it later on.
                like if - const name = 'Allen'
                          document.write(name)
            the above will display the name as 'Allen'
            AND IF, we declare the variable name again,
            like if - const name = 'Allen'
                      name = 'Sall'
                      document.write(name)
            the above will display an error since const can be declared only once.


#7] if we declare a variable but not give an value to it and call it using document.write, then it will give output as'undefined'

        like suppose we declare an variable -  var name;
                                               document.write(name);
                                the above will display output on the screen as 'undefined'
    same way like suppose we declare an variable -  let name;
                                                    document.write(name);
                                the above will display output on the screen as 'undefined'
    but for const it will display output on console.


#8] There are two rules while naming Variables,
    1. The first letter should always start with - _ $ a-z A-Z
    2. The second letters can consist of - _ $ a-z A-Z 0-9
    (Note that we cannot include hypen(-) in our variable name)


#9] We can specify multiple Variables in one line like, var a = 10, b = 20, c = 30
                                                                    OR
                                                        let a = 10, b = 20, c = 30
                                                                    OR
                                                        const a = 10, b = 20, c = 30
    AND
    We can also output them in single line by, document.write(a,b,c)
