#1] There are different types of string functions in JavaScript, let's see them one by one,

    1. typeof -> gives the type of variable i.e string, number, boolean, object, etc..
        var name = "Allen";
        document.write(typeof name); -> It will display the type of variable name, i.e string in this case.


    2. length -> gives the length of the variable even though if it's number it gives it's length too.
        var name = "Allen";
        document.write(name.length);


    3. search ->  if in a string, if there are many words and we want to find a particular word's position, search can be used
                and the word's to be searched needs to be case sensitive.
        var name = "Allen is a nerd Programmer, having less knowledge but passion for learning makes him worthy";
        document.write(name.search("passion"));


    4. indexOf -> if in a string we have many similar words, it tells the index of first occurring word.
        var name = "Allen is a nerd Programmer, Allen has less knowledge but passion for learning makes him worthy";
        document.write(name.indexOf("Allen"));

    4.1 lastIndexOf -> if in a string we have many similar words, it tells the last index of the word, like if word "Allen" is repeated
                        for atleast 10 times, then it will tell the 10th index of word "Allen"
        var name = "Allen is a nerd Programmer, Allen has less knowledge but passion for learning makes him worthy";
        document.write(name.lastIndexOf("Allen"));


    5. slice -> basically giving us the output of the entered index position of words,
                Matlb "Kaha se kaha tak means start from position 12 and display till 16 and 16 is not included.
        var name = "Allen is a nerd Programmer, Allen has less knowledge but passion for learning makes him worthy";
        document.write(name.slice(1,4));
        OR
        var name1 = "Allen is a nerd Programmer, Allen has less knowledge but passion for learning makes him worthy";
        document.write(name1.slice(12)); // display data from position 12 and all further on..
        OR
        var name2 = "Allen is a nerd Programmer, Allen has less knowledge but passion for learning makes him worthy";
        document.write(name2.slice(-12)); // start displaying the data from backwards position 12 and till the end..


    6. substring -> basically same as slice, but doesn't takes negative numbers to display from.
        var name = "Allen is a nerd Programmer, Allen has less knowledge but passion for learning makes him worthy";
        document.write(name.substring(12)); // display data from position 12 and all further on..


    7. substr -> basically same as slice, but will start displaying data and will go upto addition of given number only.
        var name = "Allen is a nerd Programmer, Allen has less knowledge but passion for learning makes him worthy";
        document.write(name.substr(13, 4)); // display data starting from position 13 and +4 positions i.e if it starts from position 13 then it will add more 4 to it(13+4 = 17),but it will go upto 16th position only..
