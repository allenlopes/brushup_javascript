#1] GetElementTag Height and Width basically gives us the Height and Width we have given to the text.
    We have two types of Height and Width,
    1. Client Height & Width
    2. Offset Height & Width

#2] What happens is when we give text a border for styling we sometimes need the actual height and Width of the border
    we have given to that text, so to remove this we use Client and Offset.
    In Offset Height & Width we might get little larger values of height & Width than Client Height & Width,
    because Offset Height & Width considers the border pixels height & Width too, that's why we might get slight
    larger values of Height & Width in Offset,
    While,
    In Client Height & Width we might get little small values of height & Width than Offset Height & Width,
    because Client Height & Width doesn't considers the border pixels height & Width, that's why we might get slight
    smaller values of Height & Width in Client,

Code ->
<div id="box" style="padding: 100px; border: 2px solid #000"> Allen </div>

<script>

    let box = document.getElementById('box');

// Here we are using Client Height and Width
console.log('Client');
    let clwidth = box.clientWidth;
    let clheight = box.clientHeight;

    console.log(clwidth);
    console.log(clheight);


// Here we are using Offset Height and Width
console.log('Offset');
    let ofwidth = box.offsetWidth;
    let ofheight = box.offsetHeight;

    console.log(ofwidth);
    console.log(ofheight);

</script>
