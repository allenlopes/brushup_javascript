for the text, but when we click on the buttons red or green it will call the changeColorRed() or changeColorGreen() functions
which has .setAttribute of inline style, and it removes the existing style on the text it has like we have already specified
style for the text with font size as 50px but it will remove it and give the default font size and set the color as red as
specified in the style. -->
