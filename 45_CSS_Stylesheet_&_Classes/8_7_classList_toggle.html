    /* What toggle does is if particular css is present it will remove it, and if it is not present it will add it.
    Like we have made an button named toggle, whenever an user clicks on that button it will turn the already applied red
    colour to the text "Allen" into normal colour, and if we click back on the button it will again add the red colour
    Basically, it removes the class if it's present and vice versa.
    To get proper understanding of this run the code and along with the ouput on the screen see the elements tab in console,
    press the toggle button and check it. */
