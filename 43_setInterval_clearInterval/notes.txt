#1] When we code we sometimes have requirement that a particular script or particular code should be executed again and
    again after some time interval, so here we can use setInterval function.


#2] setInterval ->
<script>
    setInterval(test, 1000); /* In bracket there are 2 parameters (the function to be executed, time interval(which is in milliseconds) at which the function defined should be executed)
    So for the above setInterval we want function test to run after every 1 second(since 1000 millisecond = 1 second)*/

    function test() {
        console.log('Hello'); /* In console it will print the 'Hello' after every 1 second, since we have
                              defined the setInterval function */
    }
</script>
