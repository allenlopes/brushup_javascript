#1] When we code we sometimes have requirement that a particular script or particular code should be executed again and
    again after some time interval, so here we can use setInterval function.


#2] setInterval ->
<script>
    setInterval(test, 1000); /* In bracket there are 2 parameters (the function to be executed, time interval(which is in milliseconds) at which the function defined should be executed)
    So for the above setInterval we want function test to run after every 1 second(since 1000 millisecond = 1 second)*/

    function test() {
        console.log('Hello'); /* In console it will print the 'Hello' after every 1 second, since we have
                              defined the setInterval function */
    }
</script>


#3] Suppose we want to create an counter, wherein after time interval of every 2 seconds new number is printed, like first 1, then number 2,
    then 3, 4, 5, .... likewise continue, so we can write the code as ->
<div id="counter"> 1 </div>
<script>
    setInterval(test, 2000);
    let x = 1;
    function test(){
        x++; /* It will increment the value of x after the every 2 second since time interval is set for 2 seconds only,
        so first 1 is printed, then after 2 seconds 2 is printed, then after 2 seconds 3 is printed, then after 2 seconds
        4 is printed, likewise so on... */
        document.getElementById('counter').innerHTML = x; /* It will print the counter numbers onto our screen */
        // console.log(x); /* It will print the counter numbers onto our console */
    }
</script>


#4] Suppose we have created an counter, and after a particular time we want that counter should stop, like the interval
should stop.
