<!-- Suppose we want to create an counter, wherein after time interval of every 2 seconds new number is printed, like first 1, then number 2,
     then 3, 4, 5, .... likewise continue, so we can write the code as -->

<div id="counter"> 1 </div>

<script>
    setInterval(test, 2000);
    let x = 1;
    function test(){
        x++; /* It will increment the value of x after the every 2 second since time interval is set for 2 seconds only,
        so first 1 is printed, then after 2 seconds 2 is printed, then after 2 seconds 3 is printed, then after 2 seconds
        4 is printed, likewise so on... */
        document.getElementById('counter').innerHTML = x; /* It will print the counter numbers onto our screen */
        // console.log(x); /* It will print the counter numbers onto our console */
    }
