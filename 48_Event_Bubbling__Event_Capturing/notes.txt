#1] Here we are discussing Event Bubbling and Event Capturing
    1. Child to Parent - Event Bubbling
    2. Parent to Child - Event Capturing
    3. Only Click Event

#2] Event Bubbling ->
+ It is a process that starts with the element that triggered the event and
  then bubbles up to the containing elements in the hierarchy.

+ It's like andar se bahar tak jana.
Code Understanding can be ->
<div id="1">
    <div id="2">
        <div id="3">
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

It's like when we click on id="3", then, it will first load the contents of id="3", then id="2", then id="1".
So, as we can see it goes from inside to outside.


#3] Event Capturing ->
+ An event propagates from the outermost element to the target element.
  It is the opposite of event bubbling, where events propagate outwards from the target to the outer elements.

+ It's like bahar se andar tak jana.
Code Understanding can be ->
<div id="1">
    <div id="2">
        <div id="3">
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

It's like when we click on id="3", it will first load the contents of id="1", then id="2" then finally id="3".
So, as we can see it goes from outside to inside.


#4] Single Event OR Only click event

+ Here we are just cliking on a Single event and only that part's content is loading.

+ It's like jo click ho raha hai wahi load ho raha hai nothing else.
Code Understanding can be ->
<div id="1">
    <div id="2">
        <div id="3">
        </div>
    </div>
</div>

It's like when we click on id="3", it will only load the contents of id="3", and not any other id's content is loaded.
ANOTHER SCENARIO CAN BE,
We want to load the contents of the id we are clicking and also the next id's content and stop there.
So basically we want to load 2 id's contents, so we can use stopPropagation() function for an particular id to stop
the event at that place and not continue further on.
