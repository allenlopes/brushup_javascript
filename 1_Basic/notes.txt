#1]  4 ways to see output in JavaScript ->
1. alert()
2. console.log()
3. document.write()
4. document.getElementById().innerHTML

#2] <script> tag in javascript can be written anywhere in HTML document, whether it is in <head> tag or <body> tag
there's no difference in writing it anywhere.

#3] if we are outputing javascript with console.log, then we will see that in our browser's console and not on the home page.

#4] if we are outputing javascript with document.write(), whatever the text is typed inside(), we will see the output on the screen itself.

#5] suppose we are outputing javascript with document.write() and we made a spelling mistake or any other syntax error, like document.writ(), then the
error for incorrect syntax will not be displayed directly on the screen, rather it will be displayed on the console.


#6] Let's say we want to output inside the HTML tag, then we will create a <div id="box"> tag in html along with it's id,
and refer the id within javascript's document.getElementById('box').innerHTML = "Sentence" and this will display the
Sentence into out html tag.


#7] Note that HTML renders code from up to down, so best practice it to put the <script> tag at the last of the HTML code,
so that first the HTML code is loaded and then the JavaScript code is referred to it.


#8] If you want to link external javascript file into the html file then, use <script src="my.js"></script> into the html file,
where script tag with source address of the external javascript file needs to mentioned in the src.

#9] As I mentioned in Point #7] that HTML renders code from up to down, so best practice it to put the <script> tag at the last of the HTML code,
but an another solution is to use 'defer' in our <script> tag i.e if we have initialized <script> tag before the html then,
we can use <script defer src="my.js"></script> wherein when we use 'defer' it let's the HTML load first then the javascript
code is run, even if javascript is initialized before the html.

#10] We can create multiple javascript files and link them into html file with <script> tag, i.e we cam have as many as
<script> tag inside out html file.


#11] There are 2 Q's which arises i.e where should we write JavaScript, 1. inside our html file only within the <script> tag,
or 2. Create a new javascript file and write the whole javascript code inside that file and link that javascript file inside
our html file with the <script src> tag.
So, it is adviseable that is a particular javascript code is to be used on just single html page, we can you the 1st method,
else if particular javascript code can be used in different files, then we can use the 2nd method.
