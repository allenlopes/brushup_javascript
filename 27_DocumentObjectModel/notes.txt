#1] Document Object Model(Also known as DOM) is an interface, and with DOM we can perform
    4 operations on our HTML attribute and element,
    1. get
    2. set
    3. add
    4. delete


#2] With DOM any HTML tag or attribute value can be retrieved(get), value can be be set, add something, delete something.


#3] For the following basic html page code ->

<html>
    <head>
        <title>My Page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <div>
            <h1>Allen</h1>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p></p>
            Num1 <input type="text" id="num1"/>
            Num2 <input type="text" id="num2"/>
            <input type="submit" />
        </div>
    </body>
</html>

Let's see how it's Document Object Model is,
Hierarchy of Document Object Model ->
    document
        html
            head
                title
            body
                div1
                    h1
                div2
                    p
                    input1
                    input2
                    input3

Whenever we want to manipulate on our page we can do it with the help of Document Object Model(DOM).
